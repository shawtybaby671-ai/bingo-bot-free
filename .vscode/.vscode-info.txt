VS Code Configuration Files

These JSON files contain comments, which is supported by VS Code's JSONC (JSON with Comments) format.
Standard JSON parsers may report them as invalid, but VS Code handles them correctly.

Files:
- settings.json: Editor and Python configuration
- launch.json: Debug configurations
- tasks.json: Automated tasks
- extensions.json: Recommended extensions

All files are valid JSONC and will work correctly in Visual Studio Code.
